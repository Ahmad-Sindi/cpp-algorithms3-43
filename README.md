# Algorithm Challenge #43 – Replace Words Using Custom Functions (Level 3)

🧠 Problem Description  
-
This program replaces words in a string **without using built-in replace()**.  
Instead, it uses a custom approach based on splitting, processing, and rejoining text.

The algorithm also supports:
- Case-sensitive replacement
- Case-insensitive replacement

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- How to tokenize strings using custom logic
- Processing text as structured data (vectors)
- Case normalization for flexible comparisons
- Building reusable utility functions
- Designing algorithms using composition instead of shortcuts

---

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**  
Welcom To Pk , Pk is nice Country

**Replace:**  
pk → KSA

**Output (Case-Insensitive):**  
Welcom To KSA , KSA is nice Country

📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++  
- **File Name:** replace_words_custom.cpp  
- **Challenge Level:** 3  
- **Challenge Number:** #43

💬 Engineering Concept
-
This challenge applies **Functional Decomposition**:

Breaking a complex operation into:
- Split
- Transform
- Join

This approach improves readability, testability, and long-term maintainability.
